SQLRemoteLogging.pas is a unit written for the purposes of documenting program behavior and posting it to a remote SQL server.


The following constants are defined:

	rlTables = 'log_entry';
        rlDatetime = 'log_datetime';
        rlRunType = 'run_type';
        rlSource = 'source';
        rlDestination = 'destination';
        rlClientId = 'log_instance_id';
        rlAction = 'log_action';
        rlConfiguration = 'configuration';


The following are the public properties:

        UseColumns : Boolean /*Allows for useage of columns in the SQL insert statement 
     			     	generated by Save Log. If not specified, defaults to TRUE*/
         
	ColumnList : TStringList /*If using this property, make sure that the order of the items 
      				    match the order of ValuesList. As such, it is not recommended 
      				    to modify this property directly.*/


	ValuesList : TStringList /*If using this property, make sure that the order of the items 
      			 	    match the order of ColumnList. As such, it is not 
      				    recommended to modify this property directly.*/        




The following calls are available:

	Constructor Create; 
		Initializes a RemoteLog object.


	Procedure SetTable(TableName : String);
        	Sets the table that the RemoteLog object is logging to. 
		/* Currently limited to one table per instance of RemoteLog object */ 
		


	Procedure AddColumn(ColumnName : String);
        	Adds a column to the SQL insert statement that is generated on SaveLog. 
    		/* This call requires a call to AddValue to be made immediately following this.
      	     	     As such, it is advised that you use AddColumnValuePair */


	Procedure AddValue(Value : String);
		Adds a Value to the SQL insert statement that is generated on SaveLog. 
		/* This call requires a call to AddColumn to be made immediately preceding this.
  	     	    As such, it is advised that you use the newer AddColumnValuePair */


	Procedure AddColumnValuePair(ColumnName : String; Value : String);
        	Adds both a Column and a Value to the SQL insert statement 
		 that is generated on SaveLog.


	Function CurrentDatetime : String;
		Returns the current date and time in the following format 
		 (YYYYMMDD hh:mm:ss.zzz) where ‘z’ stands for milliseconds. 




	Procedure SetConnectionString(ConnectionString : String);
        	This allows you to specify which SQL server to connect to.
          	/*If connection string is not specified, it defaults to getting connection 
 	      	   information from RemoteLog.udl in the current directory */


	Procedure DeleteColumn(ColumnName : String);
		This allows you to delete a column name.


	Procedure DeleteValue(Value : String);
		This allows you to delete a value.        


	Procedure DeleteColumnValuePair(Index : Integer);
        	This allows you to delete both a column and a value by referencing the 
		 index number of the pair in either ColumnList or ValuesList.


	Procedure SaveLog;
        	Assembles an SQL INSERT INTO statement based on the input given to the object 
  	  	 from calls such as AddColumnValuePair.
